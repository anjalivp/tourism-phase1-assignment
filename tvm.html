      <h1>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The capital city of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum,meaning 
        "The City of Lord Ananta"
     is an appealing blend of a strongly rooted heritage and a nostalgic
     colonial legacy. Built upon seven hills, this city has long since
     left the days when it was only used by seafaring explorers behind 
    - today, Trivandrum is an expensive metropolis with quaint urban 
    charm and plenty of architectural and historical places to visit. 
    In addition, Trivandrum is a gateway to nearby popular beach towns
    of Kovalam and Varkala.
  </p>
  <p>
      The place is well connected to most of the other major cities
      of India through rail, road, and air network. Because of its
      proximity to the sea, the climate of Trivandrum is tropical.
      This also gives Trivandrum a very pleasant weather round the
      year. The average maximum temperature can go up to 35.2 degree 
      celsius in summer months and to a minimum of 18.0 degree celsius
      in the winters. Monsoon comes to Trivandrum in the month of May
      and remains until November.

              Kerala.It started functioning on 30 June 1972. Vizhinjam was 
              a busy seaport in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Before the 
              current light was installed, there were no lighthouses at this location. 
              A day mark beacon (flag mast) must have been there in 18th century. 
              A lighted beacon was constructed in 1925 at nearby Kolachal.</p>
